# 🚀 Request Automation System: From Capture to Personalized Communication

**Optimizing lead management and customer engagement processes with AI and automation.**

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project aims to transform inbound inquiry management into a fully automated and personalized process. By leveraging artificial intelligence and no-code/low-code tools, it ensures efficient data collection, intelligent processing, and instant, tailored communication to meet each lead's needs.

---

## 🎯 The Manual Process Challenge

Service and communication teams waste valuable time on repetitive tasks:
* 📝 Manual form data collection and entry.
* 📧 Generic or delayed responses leading to low engagement satisfaction.
* 📊 Inconsistent inquiry qualification and follow-up.
* 🔗 Fragmented tracking of interactions and communications.

---

## ✨ The Intelligent Automation Solution

I designed and implemented an intelligent automation system that precisely collects, analyzes, personalizes, and manages inquiries. This solution allows teams to focus on direct assistance and high-value interactions, reducing administrative burden.

💻 Python Code
Here is the Python code snippet used within Zapier for cleaning and formatting phone numbers.

# Retrieves the raw phone number from the input data.
# 'phone_raw' is the variable name you defined in Zapier.
phone_raw = input_data['phone_raw']

# Ensures that phone_raw is a string, even if it's empty or None.
# This is a safety measure to prevent errors if the data is not text.
phone_raw_str = str(phone_raw) if phone_raw is not None else ""

# Cleans the string by keeping ONLY digits.
# This automatically removes spaces, hyphens, parentheses, letters, etc.
# Example: "813 434 0000" or "(813) 434-0000" becomes "8134340000"
cleaned_digits_only = "".join(filter(str.isdigit, phone_raw_str))

# Adds the international prefix "+52" to the beginning of the cleaned number.
# This assumes that all numbers processed by this Zap are Mexican phone numbers.
final_phone_number = '+52' + cleaned_digits_only

# Defines the output of the code. This will be the value that subsequent Zapier steps can use.
output = [{'phone_number_cleaned': final_phone_number}]
